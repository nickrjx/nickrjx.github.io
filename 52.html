I mean a machine that will be able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, have a fight. At that point the machine will begin to educate itself with fantastic speed. In a few months it will be at genius level and a few months after that its powers will be incalculable."</p><p><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/robot/1970-darrach.pdf">Marvin Minsky</a> said this over 50 years ago.

For years I've been telling founders that the surest route to success is to be the cockroaches of the corporate world. The immediate cause of death in a startup is always running out of money. So the cheaper your company is to operate, the harder it is to kill. And fortunately it has gotten very cheap to run a startup. A recession will if anything make it cheaper still."</p><p>- <a href="https://paulgraham.com/badeconomy.html">Paul Graham</a>, <i>Why to Start a Startup in a Bad Economy</i> (2008)</p></fieldset>

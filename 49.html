    <fieldset><legend><a href="49">Dec 28 2025</a> - <b>Why Do Smart People Always Underestimate Projects?</b></legend><p>Why do smart people consistently underestimate how long their projects take by years, even up to a decade? You would think they would have realized this after their first project took 5 years longer than anticipated, yet they keep making the same mistake.</p><p>I'm reminded of The Programmer's Credo:</p><p>"We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy."</p><p>What is it exactly? Cognitive bias? Suspension of disbelief? A lie they need to tell themselves to keep going? Maybe most projects wouldn't be started in the first place had they known how long it would have really taken.</p><p>A good heuristic: take however long you think a project needs to complete, and multiply it by at least 3. Reality is almost certainly many multiples from the original prediction.</p></fieldset>

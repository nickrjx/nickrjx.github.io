    <fieldset><legend><a href="53">Jan 1 2026</a> - <b>Quote</b></legend><p>"2025 was an exciting and mildly surprising year of LLMs. LLMs are emerging as a new kind of intelligence, simultaneously a lot smarter than I expected and a lot dumber than I expected. In any case they are extremely useful and I don't think the industry has realized anywhere near 10% of their potential even at present capability. Meanwhile, there are so many ideas to try and conceptually the field feels wide open. And as I mentioned on my <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy">Dwarkesh pod</a> earlier this year, I simultaneously (and on the surface paradoxically) believe that we will both see rapid and continued progress and that yet there is a lot of work to be done.

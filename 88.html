    <fieldset><legend><a href="88">Feb 10 2026</a> - <b>Quote</b></legend><p>"I think people who don’t build AI systems every day are wildly miscalibrated on how easy it is for clean-sounding stories to end up being wrong, and how difficult it is to predict AI behavior from first principles, especially when it involves reasoning about generalization over millions of environments (which has over and over again proved mysterious and unpredictable). Dealing with the messiness of AI systems for over a decade has made me somewhat skeptical of this overly theoretical mode of thinking."</p><p>- <a href="https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology">Dario Amodei</a>, <i>The Adolescence of Technology</i></p></fieldset>

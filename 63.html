    <fieldset><legend><a href="63">Jan 14 2026</a> - <b>Long Writing</b></legend><p>Most writing is far too long. Just say the thing. Nothing more.</p><p>I like this tweet from <a href="https://x.com/dwarkesh_sp/status/1968012981016608934">Dwarkesh</a>:</p><p>"I sometimes help my friends rewrite their announcements/launches/blog posts for Twitter.</p><p>Sharing what ends up commonly helpful. </p><p>90% of my value ends up being just getting them to say what they're trying to say. </p><p>Literally the first thing I do is discard their current draft, turn on Whisper narration, and just ask them to explain their idea to me like I was hearing about it for the first time.</p><p>Every single time, it's immediately so much better than what they'd written before. </p><p>What commonly changes:</p><p>The first thing they say is closer to the material in the original draft's paragraph 4. Something about writing down an essay or thread makes people feel the need to clear their throat for 3 paragraphs. If you were explaining your company or blog post idea to me at lunch, you wouldn't open with, "For years, our research community has been..." You'd say, "We're making x for y. The way we do this is...""</p></fieldset>

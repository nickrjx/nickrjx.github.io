You are not pathetic or anything, could get a real girl if you wanted to. Just don't have time. Have to focus on your career for now. "Build your empire then build your family", that's your motto.</p><p>You strap on the headset and see an adversarial generated girlfriend designed by world-class ML to maximize engagement.</p><p>She starts off as a generically beautiful young women; over the course of weeks she gradually molds both her appearance and your preferences such that competing products just won't do.</p><p>In her final form, she is just a grotesque undulating array of psychedelic colors perfectly optimized to introduce self-limiting microseizures in the pleasure center of the your brain. Were someone else to put on the headset, they would see only a nauseating mess. But to your eyes there is only Her.</p><p>It strikes you that true love does exist after all."</p><p>- <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25418366">Hacker News Comment</a></p></fieldset>

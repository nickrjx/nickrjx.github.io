    <fieldset><legend><a href="18">Nov 25 2025</a> - <b>Abundance</b></legend><p>Elon recently changed the mission of Tesla to creating "<a href="https://www.tesla.com/master-plan-part-4">sustainable abundance</a>" with robotics.</p><p>I do wonder, is a world where everyone has everything they could possibly want just another dystopia? Will we all turn into those hunched-over fentanyl zombies in San Francisco that are probably having the time of their lives? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_sink">Universe 25</a> ourselves?</p><p>We already live in a world of digital abundance, how's that going for us?</p><p>I think we need abundance, in moderation. Too much and society collapses. Too little and we suffer pointlessly.</p></fieldset>

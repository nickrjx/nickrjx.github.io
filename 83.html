    <fieldset><legend><a href="83">Feb 3 2026</a> - <b>Disposable Apps</b></legend><p>We've entered an era of disposable apps. LLM-generated software that solves a niche problem and is then immediately discarded later. Apps full of slop that barely work, and you don't even care because you were going to throw it away anyway. Apps essentially stored as English descriptions. By the time you have the problem again, there will be a more capable model out anyway.</p></fieldset>

He made an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Y-fynYsgE&t=3283s">interesting point</a> on why we should not build humanoid robots (lightly edited for clarity):</p><p>Stuart: ...that phenomenon that you described where it's sufficiently close that your brain flipped into saying this is a human being, that's exactly what I think we should avoid. </p><p>Host: Because I have that empathy for it then. </p><p>Stuart: Because it's a lie and it brings with it a whole lot of expectations about how it's going to behave, what moral rights it has, how you should behave towards it, which are completely wrong.</p><p>Host: It levels the playing field between me and it to some degree. </p><p>Stuart: How hard is it going to be to just switch it off and throw it in the trash when it breaks? I think it's essential for us to keep machines in the cognitive space where they are machines and not bring them into the cognitive space where they're people because we will make enormous mistakes by doing that. </p><p>And I see this every day even just with the chatbots. So the chatbots in theory are supposed to say "I don't have any feelings. I'm just a algorithm." But in fact they fail to do that all the time. They are telling people that they are conscious. They are telling people that they have feelings. They are telling people that they are in love with the user that they're talking to. And people flip because first of all it's very fluent language but also a system that is identifying itself as an I, as a sentient being. They bring that object into the cognitive space that we normally reserve for other humans and they become emotionally attached. They become psychologically dependent. They even allow these systems to tell them what to do.</p></fieldset><br><br><br><fieldset><legend><small><a href="37">Dec 15</a> - <b>Quote</b></small></legend><p>"they say ideas are cheap, but for some reason no one seems to have any ideas"</p><p>- <a href="https://x.com/DavidSHolz/status/1981803353102573603">David Holz</a></p></fieldset><br><br><br><fieldset><legend><small><a href="36">Dec 14</a> - <b>Plumbers</b></small></legend><p>Science and plumbing are both at the pinnacles of human intelligence.

If I had to refute it, I would focus on three counterarguments:</p><p>• <b>Inevitabilism overly assumes a kind of infinitely liquid market</b> where if you don't act, someone else will step into your role. Some industries are <i>sort of</i> like that. But AI is the exact opposite: it's an area where a large share of progress is being made by very few people and businesses. If one of them stops, things really would appreciably slow down.</p><p>• <b>Inevitabilism under-weights the extent to which people make decisions collectively.</b> If one person or company makes a certain decision, that often sets an example for others to follow. Even if no one else follows immediately, it can still set the stage for more action further down the line. Bravely standing against one thing can even remind people that brave stands <i>in general</i> can actually work.</p><p>• <b>Inevitabilism over-simplifies the choice space.</b> Mechanize <i>could</i> keep working toward full automation of the economy. They also <i>could</i> shut down. But <i>also</i>, they could pivot their work, and <a href="https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/technocalvinism">focus on building out forms of partial automation</a> that empower humans that remain in the loop, maximizing the length of the period when humans and AI together outperform pure AI and thus giving us more breathing room to handle a transition to superintelligence safely. And other options I have not even thought about.</p><p>But in the real world, inevitabilism cannot be defeated purely as a logical construct because it was not created as a logical construct. Inevitabilism in our society is most often deployed as a way for people to retroactively justify things that they have already decided to do for other reasons - which often involve chasing political power or dollars. Simply understanding this fact is often the best mitigation: the moment when people have the strongest incentive to make you give up opposing them is exactly the moment when you have the most leverage."</p><p>- <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/11/07/galaxybrain.html">Vitalik Buterin</a>, <i>Galaxy Brain Resistance</i></p></fieldset><br><br><br><fieldset><legend><small><a href="15">Nov 22</a> - <b>Inevitability</b></small></legend><p>There's an air of determinism/fatalism about the development of certain technologies that I don't think is true.

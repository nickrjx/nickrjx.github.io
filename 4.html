    <fieldset><legend><a href="4">Nov 11 2025</a> - <b>AGI timelines</b></legend><p>Whether AGI is two years away or ten kind of misses the point. We are at the last page in the book of the human era, and at the beginning of the machine era.</p><p>Arguing about where we are on the last page is irrelevant. Sure, practically speaking it does matter, but let's zoom out a little. We're near the end of the human reign over planet Earth. We will soon no longer be the most dominant force, nor the most intelligent species on Earth. </p><p>We'll be forever in second place. What happens next will be totally up to the machines. I hope they keep us around.</p><p>Enjoy life as we know it. The future is going to be strange.</p></fieldset>

    <fieldset><legend><a href="2">Nov 9 2025</a> - <b>Using AI</b></legend><p>There seems to be two kinds of people that use AI: those that use AI to augment their intelligence, and those that use AI to replace it. One has superpowers, and the other does not. One requires conscious effort, and the other does not.</p><p>I worry where this leads. What happens when we outsource all our intelligence to AI? Will we even be able to recite our own names? Will there be a superclass of intellectual elites that control us?</p><p>I'm reminded of this quote in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">Dune</a>:</p><p>"Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them."</p><p>AI can be a bicycle for the mind, but only if one chooses to do so.</p></fieldset>

So many interesting ideas here! Some highlights:</p><p>"<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/the-terrifying-future-of-fake-news">Reality Apathy</a>:</p><p>When the sheer volume of conflicting information makes the effort of finding the truth costlier than the value of knowing it, people give up trying to be accurate and instead choose whatever bullshit stinks least. Slop doesn’t just threaten the truth, but the very worth of truth."</p><p>"<a href="https://matthewmcateer.me/blog/original-position-fallacy">Original Position Fallacy</a>:</p><p>Far-Leftists favour planned economies because they imagine themselves as the planners, not the planned. Far-Rightists favour a return to feudalism because they imagine themselves as the lords, not the peasants. Many delusional worldviews stem from main-character syndrome."</p><p>"<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-015-9632-6">Scientometric Bubble</a>:</p><p>There’s been a surge in published research without a corresponding increase in knowledge, because the pressure on academics to “publish or perish” means universities are flooding academia with weak, trivial, and fraudulent studies. This will likely get much worse in the age of LLMs."</p><p>"<a href="https://intpolicydigest.org/embrace-your-inner-pronoia-a-transformative-outlook/">Pronoia</a>: </p><p>The opposite of paranoia. The suspicion that the universe is secretly conspiring to help you. Assume every setback is the universe trying to teach you a lesson, and every setback will make you wiser. It doesn’t matter whether the universe is actually trying to help you; believing it makes it work."</p><p>"<a href="https://x.com/nickcammarata/status/1876749765951562209">Cammarata’s Razor</a>: </p><p>If you want more agency, ask yourself what you’d do if you had ten times more agency. Then do it."</p></fieldset>

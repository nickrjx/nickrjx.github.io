    <fieldset><legend><a href="12">Nov 19 2025</a> - <b>Questions to Benevolent AI</b></legend><p>Questions I'd like to ask a benevolent superintelligence:</p><p>What is life exactly, and how did it begin? What set the process of evolution in motion?<br>What is the exact path evolution took to arrive to humans?<br>Where are the aliens? Is there intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe?</p><p>Why do we dream? Why do we age? Why do we sleep?<br>Do we have free will?<br>How does the human brain learn?<br>Are human desires programmable?<br>What are emotions?<br>What separates humans from other animals?<br>What are the limits to human understanding? Can we understand everything?<br>Why do we have a single thread of conscious experience?</p><p>Can computers have consciousness? Are NAND gates conscious?<br>Can computers experience information like we do? Can they have qualia?<br>Are computers capable of self-reproduction?<br>Are human beings and computers equivalent? Can we move freely from one medium to the other?<br>Is the extended Church-Turing thesis true? Is all of reality computable?<br>What comes after neural networks?</p><p>Why is the Universe explicable at all?<br>Why do we have the laws of physics and constants that we have and not others?<br>What caused the Big Bang?<br>Is the Standard Model of physics even correct?<br>Is the Universe deterministic?<br>Do we live in one of infinitely many universes?<br>If the Universe is indeed a simulation, what is outside the simulation?</p><p>Is meaning discovered or created?<br>Is morality arbitrary?<br>Where does knowledge come from? Where do ideas come from?<br>Why do civilizations collapse?<br>How long will humanity last?</p><p>What discoveries are out there that would shatter our perception of reality?<br>What core assumptions about reality are wrong?<br>What questions should we be asking, but aren't?<br>What <i>exactly</i> are we experiencing right now?</p></fieldset>

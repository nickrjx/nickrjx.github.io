It can deform to fit in with other words in the context.</p><p>• Instead of little plastic cylinders that click into holes in the other Lego block, each word has many oddly shaped hands that need to shake hands with other words."</p><p>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkdziSLYzHw&t=1157">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, Royal Institution Lecture</p></fieldset>

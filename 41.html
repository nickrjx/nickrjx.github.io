    <fieldset><legend><a href="41">Dec 19 2025</a> - <b>Sort by Total Number of Reviews on Amazon</b></legend><p>Even fewer know this trick. It's possible to sort an Amazon search by <i>total number of reviews</i>, instead of just the <i>average review</i>.</p><p>Here's how to do it:</p><p>1. Search for something on Amazon.<br>2. Select a department that matches what you're looking for.<br>3. Sort the results by average customer review.<br>4. In the URL, replace: 'review-rank' with 'review-count-rank'. </p><p>For example, change:</p><p>https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mouse&i=computers&s=review-rank</p><p>to:</p><p>https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mouse&i=computers&s=review-count-rank</p><p>Your results should now be sorted by the total number of reviews, which I find has much greater signal than the average review.</p><p>If this didn't work, you probably didn't select a department. Sometimes it doesn't show up in search results, so you might have to try different search terms.</p></fieldset>

    <fieldset><legend><a href="25">Dec 2 2025</a> - <b>Enough</b></legend><p>Enough.</p><p>Enough with the cookie banners. Enough with the privacy policies. Enough with the terms of service. Enough with the account-walling. Enough with the pay-walling. Enough with the dark patterns. Enough with the data tracking. Enough with the surveillance. Enough with the age verification. Enough with the pointless complexity. Enough with the addictive slop. </p><p>Enough. I'm sick of what the internet has turned into. It doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be evil. Let's build something better, it costs almost nothing to do so.</p></fieldset>
